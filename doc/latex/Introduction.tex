Every year there are more flights starting from the airports of Europe. Therefore arises the question, whether the passengers can be transported more efficiently. In this paper we describe the efficiency as passengers transported per time. The goal is to maximize this efficiency and transport as many passengers as possible in a given time period. For this optimization the resources should only be redistributed, but no additional planes or airports have to be added to the system. 
We assume, that the most efficient way to transport these people is a compromise between distance to the destination and the size of the target airport. If the flight is long distance, then the destination airport has to be large, so that enough passengers have the desire to take this flight. If the distance is short, on the other hand, the flight is still worthwhile.
