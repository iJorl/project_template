The amount of people transported by plane in Europe has been rising in the last years and is predicted to grow further in the next years. This growth brings many questions and challenges. Many airports already operate at the limit of their capacity and the environment is suffering under the increasing air traffic. \cite{eurocontrol1} In this paper we discuss the approach of maximizing the amount of people transported in the European air network. In an optimised scenario planes would be able to fill their capacity and more people could be transported with the same resources. This increase of efficiency of the planes would help with counteracting the pressure on the European flight network. 
We will discuss this problem with a model, which is inspired by the path finding of ant colonies. Ants have been found to be very efficient in finding paths, which lead to food sources. Those paths are optimised in terms of travel time to the source and the quality of the food.
