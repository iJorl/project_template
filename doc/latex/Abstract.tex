The amount of people transported by train in Switzerland has been constantly rising in the last years. This growth brings many questions to the SBB, the largest train company in Switzerland. \citep{SbbStats} In this paper we discuss the approach of maximizing the amount of people transported in the Swiss rail network. In an optimised scenario trains would be able to fill their capacity and more people could be transported with the same resources. This increase of efficiency would help with counteracting the pressure on the rail network. 
We will approach this problem with a model, which is inspired by the path finding of ant colonies. Ants have been found to be very efficient at finding paths, which lead to food sources. Those paths are optimised in terms of travel time to the source and the quality of the food.
